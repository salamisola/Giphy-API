# Giphy-API

// GIF Filtering
// This is a GIF filtering application where user clicks on any button to display GIFs.
// There will be ten interest displayed as buttons on the page.
// User can click on any of the topic buttons to display desired GIFs 
// When user clicks on a button, the page displays ten Gifs 
// There is also a text field and a button to add new topic to the buttons at the top of the page
// When user types into the text field and click "Add New Topic" button, a new category is added to the buttons at the top of the page
// At the bottom of each Gif, there is a rating for each Gif

Outstanding Task

1 - Ability to remove last topics added by user
2 - Ability to toggle between still and animated Gifs 

Bug
1 - When the page is refreshed, the new topic added to the array disappears

Enhancement
1- Make the page container resizable when Gifs are displayed
